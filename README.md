# OSU_DocAnalysis_Fall2015_Assign3

Brief Overview:
===
<!--- Please see [Assignment 3](https://github.com/wuga214/OSU_DocAnalysis_Fall2015_Assign3/blob/master/NLP_Assignment_Description.pdf) for full instructions on the lab and assignment and what specifically should be completed and submitted.  However, -->

In brief, the lab and assignment tasks are as follows:

1. Look through all of the provided code... it will save you a lot of time!

2. Write a keyphrase extractor based on an implmentation of only the C-value method (ignore the NC-value part) from the following paper: [Keyphrase Extraction with C-value / NC-value method](http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/sophia.ananiadou/ijodl2000.pdf).  Sample code in [RegEx.java](https://github.com/wuga214/OSU_DocAnalysis_Fall2015_Assign3/blob/master/code/ATR/src/extraction/RegEx.java) will be useful.

3. Evaluate the keyphrase extractor on NSF abstracts spanning over a decade (see data link below).

4. Visualize evolution of extracted key phrases frequency in Python using matplotlib and pandas (Anaconda or Enthought Python installations recommended).

More information to follow in the Assignment handout... coming soon!
